This project was created so that we implement a full-stack web application, based on 3-tier architect. insurance Sales Tools, which is the name of our app, offers to insurance consultants useful tools for calculations like pension, savings, investments etc. In addition, insurance consultant is able to know the investments profile of their customer by means of filling in a form. In case that insurance consultant manage to close the customer, the app store customerâ€™s data so that the insurance consultant can contact with them.
